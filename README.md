# Using NetlifyCMS with Hugo SSG

Following [NetlifyCMS Docs](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/hugo/)

## Creating a new site

Open a terminal and create a Hugo Site

```zsh
victorkane@Victors-MacBook-Air hugo % hugo new site hugo-with-netlify
Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in /Users/victorkane/Work/learn/hugo/hugo-with-netlify.

Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or
   create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.
2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
   with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>/<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.
```

In another terminal we are going to start the Hugo local server and leave it running for the duration of the session

```zsh
% cd ~/Work/learn/hugo/hugo-with-netlify
% hugo server
